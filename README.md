## Description
The goal of this project is to create a simple shell. Will be your own little
bash or zsh. You are going to learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

### Scheme
![Scheme](minishell.png)

[Back To The Top](#minishell)

---

### Developed commands
```bash
- Find and launch the appropriate executable.
- Builtins:
    - echo (-n flag included)
    - cd (with absolute and relative path)
    - pwd
    - export
    - unset
    - env
    - exit
- ; will have to separate the commands on the command line.
- Redirects >, ‚Äú>>‚Äù y < should work as in bash, except in fd aggregations.
- Environment variables ($ followed by characters) should work like in bash.
- Pipes | should work like in bash.
- $? it should work like in bash.
- ctrl-C, ctrl-D y ctrl-\ should show the same result as in the bash.
```
